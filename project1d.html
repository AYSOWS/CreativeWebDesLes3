    <p>In information technology, the hardware is the physical aspect of computers, telecommunications, and other devices. The term arose as a way to distinguish the "box" and the electronic circuitry and components of a computer from the program you put in to make it do things.</p><br>

    <img src="img/desktop.jpg">
    <p>When using the computer hardware, an upgrade means adding new hardware to a computer that improves its performance, adds capacity, or new features. For example, a user could perform a hardware upgrade to replace the harddrive with a SSD to get a boost in performance or increase the number of files that maybe stored. Also, the user could increase the RAM so the computer may run more smoothly.</p><br>
